Li-Li Ye is a Ph.D. student in Prof. [Ying-Cheng Lai](http://chaos1.la.asu.edu/~ylai1/)'s chaos group at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). L.-L. Ye's current research interests are applying machine learning in quantum control, quantum computation, and quantum many-body scars. In addition, L.-Li. Ye is exploring the quantum transport properties and Riemannian geometry on relativistic quantum chaos with Dirac materials.
